    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Delicious crispy shrimp coated in a bread crumb-Parmesan mixture. My
      family can't get enough of it! I would suggest doubling the recipe if you
      have very large eaters because this is addictive! Serve with pasta and
      salad.

      <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>

        glass casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and garlic powder in a
        large resealable plastic bag. Seal and shake to mix ingredients
        together. Add shrimp and shake to coat.
